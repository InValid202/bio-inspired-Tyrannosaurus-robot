## Theory
### CPG with VRNs

<img src="https://github.com/InValid202/bio-inspired-Tyrannosaurus-robot/blob/main/source%20image/so2.jpg" width="800" height="400" />

spreadsheets for represent CPG and VRNs: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AZzXm8qZo_j3j6RvV-UtCaSccyqd9fPiu6YYuq5pqpM/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AZzXm8qZo_j3j6RvV-UtCaSccyqd9fPiu6YYuq5pqpM/edit?usp=sharing)

as you can see in the spreadsheets you will see a output from both VRNs will always shift a little bit early than original output of SO2 so i assign each VRNs output for each side to the front motor that has responsibility to lift up a leg and assign back motor with output from CPG, this config will generate a pattern of walking by lift up a leg with front motor and follow by stretch leg back with back motor. and other good thing about using VRNs that i can adjust input to modify amplitude of VRNs output. so, i can make my robot turn left and turn right. for example, if i want to turn left i can lower my input1 to make O8 amplitude get lower and will result in lower lifting range but right side still has the same lifting range as before, my robot will start to turn left by it own. 

### Hormone

### System diagram

core concept of this system diagram was to use a Arduino UNO R4 handle all low level control such as drive motor or maybe control a buzzer follow by message from ROS node, and use other ros node handle all high level control such as hormone system calculation and CPG with VRNs

After trying to use this system diagram as the core concept for programming, I found that rosserial on the Arduino UNO R4 couldn't handle a message from the ROS CPG node. So, I integrated the following nodes together in the Arduino UNO R4 and ended up with this diagram:

### Distance calculation Between an Object and a Camera
#### Equation for Finding the Distance Between an Object
and a Camera

𝐷 = 𝑘 / d

Where:

• 𝐷 is the size of the object in the image

• 𝑑 is the distance between the camera and the object

• 𝑘 is a constant that needs to be determined from the actual size of the object

#### Finding the Constant 𝑘
If you know the actual size of the object ( 𝑆 ), you can use the following relationship to
find the constant 𝑘 :

𝑘 = 𝐷 * 𝑑

However, since we do not have the distance ( 𝑑 ) and the diameter in the image ( 𝐷 ), we
need to use the actual size of the object ( 𝑆 ) as a basis to create a general equation.
Suppose you have the actual size of the object 𝑆 = 40 mm.

#### Creating the General Equation
We know that the size of the object in the image ( 𝐷 ) is inversely proportional to the
distance ( 𝑑 ), with a constant 𝑘 that is related to the actual size of the object 𝑆 :

𝑘 = 𝑆 * 𝑑

Thus, the equation becomes:

𝐷 = 𝑘 / d

When 𝑘 = 𝑆 * 𝑑

#### Summary of the Equation

𝐷 = (𝑆 * 𝑑) / 𝑑 = 𝑆

If you know the actual size of the object and the size in the image, you can find the
distance:

𝑑 = 𝑘 / 𝐷

If the constant 𝑘k is not known, you need to know the size of the object in the image
for a given distance or know the focal length of the camera to establish this relationship.

#### Example Usage

Suppose you know the actual size of the object 𝑆=40 mm. and the size of the object in
the image 𝐷 :

If you know that the size of the object in the image at a distance 𝑑 = 10 cm. is 𝐷 = 100
mm. :

1. Find the constant 𝑘 :
𝑘 = 𝐷 * 𝑑 = 100 * 10 = 1000
2. Use the general equation:
𝐷 = 1000 * 𝑑
3. If the size of the object in the image 𝐷D is 50 mm and you want to find 𝑑d :
𝑑 = 1000 / 50 = 20 cm.

This equation can be used when you know the actual size of the object and have
information about the size of the object in the image or the distance in one case to find
the constant 𝑘 first.
